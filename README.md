# Rahmat Fajri
**It's My Portfolio**

I am a  fresh graduate from Brawijaya University, majoring in Computational Physics. I have an interest in machine learning and enjoy exploring everything about data. During my university, I continuously find ways to develop my passion and skills such as joining training programs and doing some personal projects. I'm seeking a job with a healthy work environment where I can improve my skills and knowledge efficiently for organizational growth.
